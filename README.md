# Gender-Identification-of-Author-from-Work
Gender identification from text uses linguistic analysis to detect patterns like pronoun usage, tone, and stylistic choices. While these features may hint at the author's gender, the approach isnâ€™t definitive as writing styles vary, and gendered language can be neutral or influenced by cultural norms. It's probabilistic, not absolute.
